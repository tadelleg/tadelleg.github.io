Developed a neural network model in Python to classify drug types based on patient data. The dataset included features such as age, gender, blood pressure levels, cholesterol levels, and the sodium-to-potassium ratio. Key highlights of the project:

- Achieved **95% accuracy** in classifying drug types.
- Focused on optimizing recall and F1-scores for multi-class classification.
- Leveraged a dense neural network with activation functions optimized for performance.

**Insights:**
- High sodium-to-potassium ratios strongly correlated with Drug Type X.
- Patients with normal blood pressure and high cholesterol were likely to be prescribed Drug Type Y.
- Gender showed minimal impact on drug classification.

**Key Tools Used:**
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
